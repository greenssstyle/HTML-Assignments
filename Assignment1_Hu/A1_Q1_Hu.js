(iii) Client-side programming is designing programs that operate only on the client's side of the communication. This means that the server is mostly not involved in any client-side programming. Functions such as validating input, browser interactions, and client interface make up client-side programming. Client-side programming can be viewed and modified by the user.

Server-side programming is the opposite, where the program runs on the server, unseen by the client. Server-side scripts can be used to give custom responses to clients' inputs, HTTP request handling, and provide access to server-side software.
